When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if you need to share your work with others or if you need to access your work from various locations/computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not be ready to incorporate other commits into your file. Or you may want time to review the commits on github and determine which ones you'd like to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork allows you to create a copy of another repository so that you can make changes to it.
clone will copy the repository from github to local or local to local
branch will create a different version than the current. think dev vs. production.
